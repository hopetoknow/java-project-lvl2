# Java Project Lvl2
Java Project Lvl2 is a CLI application that allows you to compare text differences between two files.

Application features:
 - Supports various input formats: YAML and JSON
 - Report generation as plain text, stylish and JSON

I use the picocli framework to easily create a CLI application and
Gradle as a build automation tool. GitHub Actions acts as a continuous integration (CI) platform.
The JUnit framework is used to write tests. I also use Make & Makefile for frequently used commands in order to save time.
